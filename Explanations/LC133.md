### Clone Graph

Question is basically to make a **deep copy** of the given **connected** graph. A deep copy is basically an exact copy of the given object but the same variable is now storing a fresh copy of the object and is simply not pointing to the memory location of the object. \
So I had seen the question before last year and chutiya me had ignored it, not getting the logic and not even understanding the question properly. But theek me, gave quite some time to the problem and had some ideas but wasn't able to implement it again.

So the basic logic is, since we don't want to keep on saving the same node again and again, we use a map to store the reference of new ptr to old ptr. That was it. And your normal BFS. 

```c++
    Node* cloneGraph(Node* node){
        if(!node) return NULL;
        unordered_map<Node*,Node*>umap; //Keeping the ref for old and new ptr here
        Node* cp = new Node(node->val); //Creating the new copy for the node.
        umap[node] = cp; //keeping the reference
        queue<Node*>q; //BFS
        q.push(cp);
        while(!q.empty()) {
            Node* temp = q.front();
            q.pop();
            for(auto x: temp->neigbors) {
                if(!umap.count(x)) {
                    Node* tp = new Node(x->val);
                    umap[x] = tp; //Above and below basically involves creating the new nodes for the neighbor of the current node
                }
            }
            umap[temp]->neigbors.push_back(umap[x]); //This is the shit I suck at. So what is being done here is umap[temp] already exists in our map. See the first cp node that we made, it's basically that. Now we need to save the neighbors of this node as well and we are pushing those only. 
        }
    }
```
