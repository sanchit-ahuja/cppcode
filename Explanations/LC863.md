### Nodes K distance away from a target node

We need to find all the nodes K distance away from a certain target node
Consider the example below:

We need to find all the nodes at a distance 2 from 5
#### Logic:
The first think that I thought was getting all the nodes from target. Then calculate the distance of root node till target node. And then get all nodes at distance dist-K except the target itself.
Long and I got confused with the implementation.(Couldn't get to implement the dist function properly. ) I gave up after half an hour or something. 
I went through the discussion :(
So we would need to build a graph, makes it easier to reach any Kth node from the target.(REMEMBER!!!!!) To build that graph, we would also need it's parent, reach the back of the graph no. Let me give you an example,
Let's mark the parents of the above picture \
parent[3] = Null \
parent[5] = 3 \
parent[1] = 3 \
parent[6] = 5 \
parent[2] = 5 \
. \
. \
. \
. \
So I was halfway there at the soln, I was correct at getting the sub nodes of target but to get the nodes via root, I require the parents of the nodes above me, or parent of the target. I need to store the parents then. Hmmmmm.... 
I can make a map to hash the parents of all nodes then.
So I build the graph then : 

```c++
     void buildgraph(TreeNode* root, TreeNode* parent,unordered_map<TreeNode*,TreeNode*>&umap) {
        if(root == NULL) {
            return;
        }
        umap[root] = parent; //Mark the parent of curr node
        buildgraph(root->left,root,umap); //Pass the curr node since it will be the parent of the left and the right child of it
        buildgraph(root->right,root,umap);
    }
```

We are almost done. Now we just need to apply dfs to get all the nodes

```c++
    void dfs(unordered_map<TreeNode*,TreeNode*>&umap,unordered_set<TreeNode*>&visited,TreeNode* root,vector<int>&ans,int K) {
        if(root == NULL || visited.count(root)) {
            return;
        }
        visited.insert(root); //Normal dfs don't visit the node again if already visited
        if(K == 0) {
            ans.push_back(root->val);
        }
        K -= 1; //A hack I discovered today. Better to subtract out the recursion than in it.
        dfs(umap,visited,root->left,ans,K); //The part which I implemented correctly
        dfs(umap,visited,root->right,ans,K); // Sameee
        dfs(umap,visited,umap[root],ans,K); // This is the new shit, This part is basically recurring out of the root node
        //When we have explored the sub trees of the target, we go up to its parent, wont go down since already visited, we keep on going up until we find rest of the nodes and traverese the complete tree.
    }
```
