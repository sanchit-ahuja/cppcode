## Interval List Intersections

Given two lists of closed intervals, each list of intervals is pairwise disjoint and in sorted order.

Return the intersection of these two interval lists.

*(Formally, a closed interval [a, b] (with a <= b) denotes the set of real numbers x with a <= x <= b.  The intersection of two closed intervals is a set of real numbers that is either empty, or can be represented as a closed interval.  For example, the intersection of [1, 3] and [2, 4] is [2, 3].)*

``` Input: A = [[0,2],[5,10],[13,23],[24,25]], B = [[1,5],[8,12],[15,24],[25,26]]``` \
```Output: [[1,2],[5,5],[8,10],[15,23],[24,24],[25,25]]```

```c++
       vector<vector<int>> intervalIntersection(vector<vector<int>>& A, vector<vector<int>>& B) {
           int i = 0,j = 0; //Basically a two ptr problem
           vector<vector<int>>ans;
           while(i<A.size() && j<B.size()) {
                int start = max(A[i][0],B[j][0]);
                int end = min(A[i][1],B[j][1]);
                if(start<=end) {
                    ans.push_back({start,end});
                }
                if(B[j][1]>A[i][1]) {
                    i++;
                }
                else {
                    j++;
                }
           }
           return ans;
       }
