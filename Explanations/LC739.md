### Daily Temperature (Stack problem)
Basically tell how many days we have to wait in future to get a higher temp than current temp

```T = [73, 74, 75, 71, 69, 72, 76, 73], your output should be [1, 1, 4, 2, 1, 1, 0, 0] ```

Key idea is to store the idx in a stack and if we find a temperature greater than the one on stack. We keep popping out and fill in the difference b/w the current idx i and the one stored on the stack.

```c++
    vector<int>solve(vector<int>&T) {
        stack<int>s;
        vector<int>ans(T.size(),0);
        for(int i = 0;i < T.size();i++) {
            while(!s.empty() && T[i]>T[s.top()]) {
                int idx = s.top();
                ans[idx] = i - idx;
                s.pop();
            }
            s.push(i);
        }
        return ans;
    }

```
