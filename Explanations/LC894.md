### Generate all full binary trees
#### A full binary tree basically has exactly 2 children or no children at all.

Above is an example of full binary trees with N = 7

- First observation that strikes in mind is that N should be odd for the **full** binary tree to exist.
- Consider an example of N >= 3. N = 7. We construct a BT with N = 3 nodes. Now for left subtree we cosntruct for ith node and for right for rest of n-i-1 nodes. FBT(x) --> left and FBT(N-x-1) --> right. FBT are recursive calls.
- These can be cached to avoid multiple subproblems to be solved.
- left vector will store answer for left subtrees and right one for rightsubtrees.
```c++
    unordered_map<int,vector<TreeNode*>> umap;
    vector<TreeNode*> FBT(int n) {
        if(umap.count(n)) {
            return umap[n];
        }
        vector<TreeNode*> ans;
        if(n == 1) {
            TreeNode* temp = new TreeNode(0);
            ans.push_back(temp);
            return ans;
        }
        if(n%2==0) {
            return ans;
        }
        else {
            for(int i =1;i<N;i++) { //Till N-1 because of N-1 call in the function
                vector<TreeNode*> left1 = FBT(i); //Solve  the left subtree problem
                vector<TreeNode*> right1 = FBT(n-i-1); //Solving the right subtree problem
                for(auto left : left1) { //Iterating for all left and right subtrees to connect their links
                    for(auto right: right1) {
                        TreeNode* temp = new TreeNode(0);
                        temp->left= left; 
                        temp->right = right;
                        ans.push_back(temp); //Creating the last subtree bottom up recursion. Neeche se upar.
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
