### Delete node in BST

This is a tricky problem.

#### **Example**
```root = [5,3,6,2,4,null,7]
key = 3

    5
   / \
  3   6
 / \   \
2   4   7
```
Deleting the node 3 would result in 

```
    5
   / \
  4   6
 /     \
2       7
```
#### There are 2 cases to handle. (1 is for null exculded here.)
- If the key to be deleted has only one child.
- If the key to be deleted has 2 children
The first case can be handled easily.

If the left child is null, return right child and vice-versa.

2 children are the cases which are more difficult to handle.
What can be done is, if there are 2 children, get the minimum in the right subtree under the key and replace that minimum with it. And then delete the minimum one below recursively. It will boil down to the 1st case we discussed above.

```c++
    TreeNode* solve(TreeNode* root, int key) {
        if(root == NULL) {
            return NULL;
        }
        if(key<root->val) {
            root->left = solve(root->left,key);
        }
        else if(key > root->val) {
            root->right = solve(root->right,key);
        }
        else {
            if(root->left == NULL) {
                return root->right;
            }
            else if(root->right == NULL) {
                return root->right;
            }
            TreeNode* mini = findmini(root->right); //Minimum would be the best in the right subtree
            root->val = mini->val;
            root->right = solve(root->right,mini->val); //Recursively delete the old node.
        }
        return root;
    }
    TreeNode* findmini(TreeNode* root) {
        while(root->left) {
            root = root->left;
        }
        return root;
    }
```
