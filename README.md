# Experiments with Data Structures from CLRS

### Tried to implement DS from CLRS using C++
#### Edit
There are few(actually a lot) of sorting that needs to be done into problems *solved* and concepts learnt.
Added more DS including Hashtables, tries, trees(few of them).
Still too *lazy* to sort them properly. Some questions from CodeForces have codes so could be looked upon easily.
